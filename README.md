# Sublime Text snippets

These are [Sublime Text snippets](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/snippets.html) we used day-to-day at [Electric Book Works](https://electricbookworks.com).

We have moved to using VS Code mostly, so this repo is not maintained. We also [share snippets for VS Code](electricbookworks/vs-code-snippets).

## Usage

For how to install and edit snippets in Sublime, [this is a great article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-guide-to-preserving-your-wrists-with-sublime-text-snippets-7541662a53f2).

In short, save any snippet to `/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User`. This location may vary by operating system and machine. On a Windows machine it may be `C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User` (where `YourUserName` is your user name on the machine).

To use a Sublime Text snippet, you type a particular series of characters then hit tab to trigger the snippet. For each of these, open the snippet code and read the `tabTrigger` to know what to type.
